# strategos
A simple strategy game.

Strategos is a simple RTS/RPG game written completely in Python with Kivy.
You control one character and have to try to maintain your domain.

***Features***
- create custom maps by using a painting program (GIMP, Paint, etc.)
- control a ruler or play as vassal
- control an army and give commands to your subordinates (which won't always listen to your commands)
- send scouts to gain information of your surroundings (which may not always be as it really is)

Please note that this game is very much still in progress. Concepts may change and a lot of the art style is still a subject to change.
