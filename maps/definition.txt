This file describes how maps are structured.

Please be aware that all maps which are not of this format are not valid anymore and are solely legacy.
They will be removed once their content has been fully ported over to the current mapping system.


Every folder in the "maps" directory is one map.

Each map should have a "default.cnk" file, which describes what happens if a certain chunk is requested, but not existent.

There can also be files in the format "<x chunk>|<y chunk>.cnk", which represent one chunk of 64x64 tiles.
The number used in the name is the number of the x and y coordinates of a tile divided by 64 with the rest cut off.
So, given the coordinates x=10 and y=64, the name of the file should be "0|1.cnk".

Both the default and the specific chunks have following JSON structure:
{
    "probabilities": {
        "forest": 0.5,
        "river": 0.1
    },
    "default": "grass"
}
The "probabilities" is optional and defines how likely it is for the generator to use that specific tile.
If the generator did not choose any of them, it will use the tile specified in "default".

Furthermore in the chunk files only (not the default.cnk) single tiles can be specified:
{
    "0|0": {
        "type": "grass",
        "population": 100,
        "base_fertility": 10
    }
}
All of the attributes are optional, except for the "type".
